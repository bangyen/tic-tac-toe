# tic-tac-toe using minimax algorithm

Implementation of a simple minimax algorithm to create a bot that can play against human and draw at worst case.
Minimax is brute-force like algorithm which minimizes maximum loss by observing all possible plays in a decision tree and picks the best choice according to a static evaluation function that evaluates the goodness or the preference of such a play.
